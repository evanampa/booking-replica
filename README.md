üè® Hotel Booking Application (Java Desktop App)
This is a desktop application developed in Java for hotel booking management. The project was created as part of a university course on Java programming and uses Java Swing (JFrame) for the graphical user interface. The application enables users to search for accommodations, book rooms, leave reviews, and allows providers to manage their listings.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java
GUI Framework: Java Swing (JFrame)
Data Storage: Data is stored in text files within the project folder.
üéØ Purpose
This project was developed as an educational tool to demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, GUI development, and the use of file-based storage to manage data in a Java application. It is designed to help users learn how to work with simple file management and data processing in Java.
